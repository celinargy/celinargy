### üôã Introducing Myself

Hello, I'm Celine. With a strong educational foundation in business and over 5 years of experience as a former executive assistant, I have a deep curiosity for understanding how things work and finding ways to optimize them. My journey into the world of Data Analytics began through my academic pursuits, collaborating with industry partners and seasoned professionals from tech giants like Yandex.

My experience provided me with an iron strength to navigate uncertainties and handle projects from start to end. I built strong resilience and I have a unique view of how customer-oriented services develop outside of EU, where digitalisation is faster and developments take place at a fast pace. 

I'm currently building a portfolio of small projects that showcase my prowess in analytics and reporting, data modeling, and SQL and Python querying.

- Skilled in Python for visualisation (Matplotlib, Seaborne), data manipulation and engineering (Numpy, Scipy), ML modelling (Sklearn)
- Experienced in data analysis and reporting using Google Sheets and Excel through Python
- Skilled in SQL for data querying, generating reports, and performing ad-hoc analyses
